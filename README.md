## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The idea for the artstyle of the game came to me when using the paper background as a placeholder, but the it just clicked that i could make a paper themed game.
- **Core Mechanics:** they are simple but work, I am happy with that I managed to implement.

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** The coding in general, but it got better by the day 
- **Bug Fixes:** A few bugs were just annyoing to find as the game didnt pron.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** How to handle console.log for bugfixing and imporving my knowledge of how code.
- **Keep it Simple:** doing it step by step and not overcomplicating my code structure.
